                <p>
                    My journey through academia and professional life has been a testament to my adaptability and passion for learning. It began in the field of biochemical engineering, where I dedicated three years immersing myself in the complexities of biology and chemistry, driven by a deep fascination with the intricate processes that govern life at a molecular level. This period was marked by rigorous study and a growing appreciation for the intersection of biology and technology.

                    However, as my interests evolved, I found myself drawn to the world of computer science. This shift represented not just a change in my academic focus but a broader expansion of my perspective on how technology could be used to solve complex problems. After a year of delving into computer science, I realized that my true calling lay in a more integrative approach. This led me to embrace the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, an educational path that I am currently pursuing with enthusiasm and dedication.

                    Parallel to my academic endeavors, I have been working as an IT specialist at the Rochester Hills Public Library for two years. This role has not only allowed me to apply my technical skills in a real-world setting but has also been a platform for continuous learning and contributing to the community. My experience in IT has been immensely fulfilling, complementing my academic pursuits.

                    In a unique twist, my initial majors in biochemical engineering and computer science have now become minors, alongside a minor in chemistry. This diverse academic portfolio underlines my commitment to a multidisciplinary approach, equipping me with a unique blend of skills and knowledge that I am eager to leverage in my future endeavors.
